Struts Build
============

This subproject provides common build components for use across multiple Struts
subprojects. While it is a subproject in and of itself, it is better thought of
as a shared directory linked into each individual subproject.

IMPORTANT:
If you are reading this in the 'build' directory of another subproject, what
you are seeing is a "window" into the build subproject. All of the files in
this directory are actually maintained in the common build subproject, and so
any changes made here will be made for *all* subprojects.



STRUTS
======

Introduction
------------

This subproject contains the source code for the "Struts" application support
package, consisting of the following major components:

- Controller servlet with action mapping technology, implementing the Model-
  View-Controller (MVC) design pattern for web applications commonly called
  "Model 2", with a servlet as the "front component".

- Comprehensive custom tag library for building internationalized JSP pages
  that have HTML forms which interact with JavaBeans that are managed
  automatically by the controller servlet.

For help with installing and using Struts, see the Struts User Guide.
