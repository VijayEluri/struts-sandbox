2006 Board Reports 


January 2006

The last quarter has been an eventful one in the Struts community. In
terms of releases, we released Struts 1.2.8, primarily to fix an XSS
vulnerability; Struts Scripting 1.0.1 is the first GA release of this
component; and Struts Shale 1.0.0 is the first Alpha release of our newest
framework.

In the wake of the web framework "unification" discussions mentioned in
our last board report, the Struts team and the WebWork team have agreed to
join forces. There have been numerous interactions between the teams, and
the team members, for some time now, and we are confident that the merger
will work well. The plan is for WebWork to come to the ASF, and for it to
provide the underpinnings for a Struts Action Framework 2.0. We anticipate
that the IP clearance process will begin shortly, now that WebWork 2.2 has
been released.

On the people front, we added Wendy Smoak as a PMC member, and Rich Feit,
Patrick Lightbody and Jason Carreira have joined us as committers. Also, a
record seven Struts committers managed to be in the same place at the same
time at ApacheCon in December, leading to some very fruitful discussions.

2005 BOARD REPORTS


October 2005 

The Struts community continues to make steady progress toward the 1.3.0 
release of "Struts Classic" and the 1.0.0 release of "Struts Shale", our 
offering for JavaServer Faces developers (JSR-127). We've added three new 
committers: Greg Reddin, Laurie Harper and Sean Schofield. Greg has been 
working on Standalone Tiles, Laurie has been working with on the Struts 
Classic release, and Sean is an Apache MyFaces committer who also been 
working on Struts Shale. We've moved our website and development 
infrastructure to Maven as our primary build, and the initial draft of our 
Mavenized website is online at struts.apache.org. Our nightly builds are 
now running on our Solaris 10 zone on helios. Active development is also 
taking place on our Standalone Tiles and Struts Ti efforts in the sandbox, 
including a substantial contribution to Struts Ti from the Beehive PageFlow 
folks.

Members of our community have also been invited to particpate in two Java 
web framework working groups. One group, "Clarity", would like to create a
best-of-breed framework that combines the features of Spring MVC, Struts 
Classic, Struts Ti, Beehive and WebWork. The "Java Web Alignment Group" has 
a similar charter, but they are trying to involve a broader range of 
frameworks. Both groups are still at the "hand waving" stage, and there is 
nothing concrete to report. The groups are already intermixing, and we hope 
the consolidation efforts will themselves consolidate. :)

The underlying issue is that there is not a clear migration path to JSR-127 
from frameworks like Struts Classic. Since many teams have several years of 
development vested in "classic" frameworks, it may be some time before the 
new formal standard displaces the entrenched de facto standard. These 
working groups would like to consolidate the classic frameworks so as to 
clear the road toward "next generation" web applications.

Despite these "interesting times", the Struts community remains united and 
amicable. Some of us are "scouting ahead" with Strut Shale and Struts Ti, 
while others trudge along with Struts Classic, but we all share the same 
path.

July 2005 

This has been another busy quarter in the Struts community. Progress is
being made towards a 1.3 release of Struts "Classic", and work is
continuing on Struts Shale. The Tiles component is in the process of being
transformed into a Struts-independent package.

On the people front, Wendy Smoak has joined us as a committer, and we are
in the process of adding Gary VanMatre. We are also in the process of
adding Hubert Rabago as a new PMC member, being in the 72 hour waiting
period at the time of writing.

--

April 2005 

This has been a busy quarter in the Struts community. We have completed
the refactoring of the Subversion repository into subprojects, and added a
new master build system using Maven. Two new subprojects have joined the
fold; Struts Shale is an alternative approach to web applications based on
JSF, and Struts Flow allows complex workflows to be implemented using
JavaScript. Our first proposal for a Struts subproject written in C#,
named OverDrive, has been introduced in our sandbox area.

On the people front, in addition to the change of PMC chair, one new
committer, Hubert Rabago, accepted an invitation to join us, and we
welcome back David Geary from emeritus to active status.

--

January 2005 

The last three months have seen renewed interest and vigor about
moving Struts forward in technology terms.  Now that we have moved
our source code repository to Subversion, we are leveraging the new
capabilities to reorganize our source code into separately deliverable
artifacts (rather than one large "wad-o-stuff"), to be managed
as subprojects which can be released on their own schedules.  This
will enable us to be more responsive to the user community's desire
for timely releases, without having to coordinate one monster release.
In addition, work is underway to rationalize the build architecture
around Maven.

Technically, Struts 1.x  continues to evolve in a manner that is
fundamentally backwards compatible, but which leverages new internal
techniques (such as the Chain of Responsibility design pattern) that
will make customization and specialization much easier.  At the same time,
experimental development around a fresh look at web application
architectures is also taking place in the form of "Shale", a
JSF-based framework, being proposed as an alternative to Struts 1.x.

2004 BOARD REPORTS

October 2004

The Struts community has recently released Struts 1.2.4 as the latest
stable version, focused on cleaning up deprecations from previous versions,
refactoring utility classes to improve separability of the core framework
from view tier dependencies, and incorporating the latest Commons libraries
on which we are dependent.

We recently completed a migration of our source code repository from
CVS to Subversion, and are leveraging its capabilities to refactor the
source code into separately releaseable components.  The first such
separate release is likely to be the Struts-Faces integration library
(an adapter between Struts and JavaServer Faces).

The community is busy planning an evolutionary path that focuses on
fundamentally backwards compatible improvements, and a revolutionary
("Struts 2") path that will leverage the industry wide lessons in how
web application frameworks should architected in the four years
since Struts was created.  The discussions are proceeding harmoniously
and productively.

July 2004 

We have started a reorganization of our repository. The goals of the refactoring 
are to better support subprojects  with their own release cycles and building 
Struts with Apache Maven. 

An initial draft of the reorganization is being done under Subversion on a 
private server, with all discussions taking place on the public DEV list. We will 
be ready to move the work to an Apache server soon, now that we have a 
consensus in favor of Subversion and Maven. 

We completed a draft of Apache Struts bylaws and developer guidelines, which 
is available at <http://struts.apache.org/bylaws.html>.

There was a discussion on the DEV list regarding the "bar" for Committership. 
The consensus is to keep the bar set fairly high and wait until a contributor has 
submitted a good number of useful patches directly to Struts. 

Our latest stable release is still 1.1 (29 June 2003). We issued a 1.2.1 release 
on 11 July 2004, which is currently catagorized as a beta. We anticipate 1.2.1 
(or a 1.2.2) being promoted to GA over the next 30 days. 


June 2004

-PMC Actions-

* Niall Pemberton is elected as a Struts Committer.

* Two new subprojects (our first) are approved. One that utilizes BSF
  so that "Actions" can be scripted rather than expressed as Java
  code. Another is a port of Cocoon's Control Flow to
  Struts. Infrastructure details are being addressed. The initial code
  for both projects were developed by a Struts PMC member, Don Brown,
  who is filing a code grant to the ASF. Both codebases are ready for
  release testing.

-Significant threads-

* Compiling Struts from source and running the Cactus tests continues
  to be a challenge for some developers. Completing the move to Maven
  should help.

-Releases-

* Stable release: 1.1 (29 June 2003).

* Next anticipated release: 1.2.1

* Anticipated time-frame (if any): Awaiting stable release of a
  dependency (Commons Validator).

-Roadmap-

* Struts 1.x will remain based on Servlet 1.2/JSP 1.1 (evolution).

* Struts 1.3.x will introduce the "Struts Chain" request
  processor. Some packages, like the taglibs, will be released as
  separate subprojects.

* Struts 2.x will be based on Servlet 2.4/JSP 2.0 (revolution).

* The Apache Struts repository will be rationalized to accomodate
  subprojects and Maven once a stable Struts 1.2.x release is available.
  Subprojects will be the unit of release. Each subproject will be a
  distinct Maven "artifact". Pending this step, the website and
  repository remain under jakarta.apache.org.

* For more see <http://jakarta.apache.org/struts/status.html>.

-Mailing list Subscriptions-

* User 1851
* User digest: 874
* Dev: 713
* PMC: 14
