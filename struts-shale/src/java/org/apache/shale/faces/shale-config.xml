  This configuration file defines the default Chain of Command configuration
  for a Catalog named "shale", which is in turn utilized by a filter
  (ShaleApplicationFilter) to perform application level controller
  functionality on every request.  You may customize these chains either
  by replacing this configuration file with a different one, or by populating
  your own versions of these commands in the "shale" catalog.
