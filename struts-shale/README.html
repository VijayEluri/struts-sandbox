<h2>1. Introduction</h2>

<h3>1.1 Background</h3>

<p>Little did anyone know, when the first few lines of code were committed to
the Struts CVS repository at Apache in June 2000, that a revolution was
brewing.  Prior to that time, there were few useful models for best practices
for the architecture of web based applications.  The best we could do was
handwaving about the relative advantages of "Model 1" versus "Model 2"
approaches.</p>

<p>The original implementation of Struts, which was released as a 1.0 product
approximately one year later, changed all that.  As more and more people
came to understand the advantages of building on top of a stable and supported
framework, and as more and more developers adopted it for their own
application development, and as more than more books helped everyone understand
how to use the framework correctly, and as more and more development tools
provided support for building Struts based applications, the world changed.
A small open source project became a defacto industry standard that, even today,
gets downloaded many tens of thousands of times per month.</p>

<p>But, that was then ... and this is now.  In the four years that Struts has
been around (a relatively infinite amount of "Internet time"), vastly improved
technologies have become available from many talented architects and designers.
Moore's Law has continued its seemingly inexhaustible progress.  Developers have
grown in their ability to understand less monolithic architectures -- as well
as developing preferences towards agility, the ability to create unit tests,
and to build applications by composition rather than inheritance.</p>

<p>One of the critical success factors for Struts has been, and continues to
be, an obvious commitment (on the part of Struts developers) to maintain and
enhance the framework in a way that remains fundamentally backwards compatible,
while embracing new technologies as they have become availalble.  This has led
to Struts being both praised (for protecting the investment of developers with
thousands of applications critically dependent on the framework) and dissed
(for being a dinosaur compared to all the "latest and greatest" favorite
technological approaches).  History has shown (in terms of continued popularity)
that this is a good strategic approach.</p>

<p>Indeed, Struts will continue to evolve in a manner that protects the
investments of existing users.  For example, the recent discussions around
using the "chain of responsibility" design pattern inside the Struts controller
to radically simplify customization and extension of the framework, while at the
same time providing historically consistent default functionality, is just one
example of this trend.  But ... it's also time for something else.</p>

<p>It is time to harvest many of the great ideas that have matured in the last
four years.  It is time to focus Struts on solving the unsolved problems, while
leveraging existing solutions instead of reinventing them.  It is time to
answer the question "if we knew then what we know now, what would Struts have
looked like?"</p>

<p>Thus, this is a proposal to fundamentally reinvent Struts ... to bring
the framework up to date.  To focus on the key value add of a framework that
focuses on the "controller" tier of the traditional Model-View-Controller
design pattern, while expanding the areas of responsibility that the
controller assumes, but at the same time radically simplifying the use
of the overall framework -- and lets you choose the portions that you
care about, rather than being monolithic.  To bring forth ... a proposal
for a future of Struts, code named the "Shale" proposal.</p>

<blockquote><em>
EDITOR'S NOTE:
Why "Shale"?  As others have pointed out, the cultural
rules of engagement at Apache encourage both evolution
and revolution in software designs.  Revolutions are
typically assigned code names while they are still under
discussion, and only gain access to the branding of the
overall project once they are accepted.  Other proposals
for Struts 2.x have talked about tearing down the walls
inside the framework, and those are Good Things.  This
proposal, on the other hand, suggests that we fundamentally
divide the notion of a web application framework into
solid individual layers, much as we see geologically in
shale deposits around our volcanoes and coastlines.  Each
layer of the framework should focus on the specific
requirements that are relevant to that layer -- and use of
one layer should not necessarily require the use of all the
rest (although it's certainly reasonable for synergies to
exist if all the layers are chosen :-).  Hence, "shale."
</em></blockquote>

<p>But first, let's examine some problems with the current architectures
of web application frameworks in general, and Struts 1.x in particular.</p>

<h3>1.2 Monolithic Controllers</h3>

<p>Most current implementations of a Model-View-Controller architecture
for web applications have focused on providing a single monolithic
controller that is responsible for the entire processing of every
incoming request.  While this paradigm is very powerful, it creates
usability and understandability problems for some application developers,
because it requires artificial separation of portions of the application
logic that (from the viewpoint of the developer) belong together.  The
most common scenario in a Struts-based application, for example, is the
following pattern:</p>
<ol>
<li>User fills out and submits the form requesting a transaction.</li>
<li>Controller routes the request to the business logic responsible
    for performing the transaction.</li>
<li>Controller routes the request to setup logic for the next form
    to be displayed.</li>
<li>Controller routes the request to the view tier component that
    displays the new form.</li>
</ol>

<p>A key issue is that, from the point of view of the person supporting
a particular business transaction, the following pieces of functionality
are tightly coupled:</p>
<ul>
<li>The setup logic for that transaction (such as retrieving
    information from the model) that is required to complete
    the presentation to the user.</li>
<li>The presentation logic in the view tier technology that
    actually generates your user interface.</li>
<li>The processing logic that will accept the incoming form
    and complete the requested transaction.</li>
</ul>

<p>Yet in Struts 1.x, for example, the setup logic and processing logic end up
in two different Actions, requiring multiple action mappings, and a tendency
for people to implement action chaining and be surprised by the results.  A
more developer-friendly approach would be to combine the tightly coupled
processing actions into a single Java class, implicitly associated in a 1:1
relationship by a (pluggable) mapper, so that the entire combination has a
single "identity" from the point of view of the application framework -- and
so that this entire combination can be treated as a unit by development tools
that choose to support it.</p>

<h3>1.3 Multiple Request Interactions</h3>

<p>One of the most significant technological challenges of developing
applications based on HTTP is dealing with the stateless aspect of the
protocol.  The servlet API provides a relatively simple mechanism for
identifying requests that are coming from the same user (sessions).  In
turn, this allows convenient state saving of information particular to
an individual user's interactions with the application.  But it doesn't
solve all of the problems.</p>

<p>In particular, it is common for individual transactions to require more
than one interaction with a user.  The servlet API offers no direct support
for maintaining state across these requests that is specific to that
transaction -- let alone deal with realities like the back button on a
browser, which can lead to incorrect interactions.  Some frameworks do more
than others to manage this problem.  In Struts 1.x, for example, you can use
the transaction token mechanism to catch the "duplicate submit" scenario.
But a more comprehensive solution go "guided dialog" transactions, with the
associated state management, would substantially improve the productivity
of developers utilizing the framework.</p>

<h3>1.4 Application Scope Features</h3>

<p>It may seem, from the above problem descriptions, that an application-level
controller has no reason for being any longer.  Yet, nothing could be further
from the truth.  There are still useful features that can be enabled by
processing on every incoming request.  In Struts 1.x, we have required all
transactions to flow through a processing servlet -- because we have used
Servlet 2.2 as the base platform, we were not able to implement these features
using servlet filters.</p>

<p>Moving to a Servlet 2.4 baseline provides us the opportunity to invoke only
the required per-every-request features that a particular application requires,
without requring a monolithic implementation.  In addition, event listeners (at
the request, session, and application) levels will be important, for example,
for implementing end-of-request cleanup operations, or detect when request
attributes of a particular type are registered, so that value add services may
be provided transparently.</p>

<p>Beyond this, however, modern application frameworks are expected to provide
standard services (or supported plugins to standard services) out of the box.
Struts needs to offer such solutions in areas that are particularly important,
yet currently require individual integration by application developers.</p>

<hr/><a name="ProposalDetails"></a>
<h2>2. Proposal Details</h2>

<h3>2.1 Overview</h3>

<p>The briefest way to state the proposed architecture is to fulfill the
following goal statement:</p>
<blockquote><em>
Divide the responsibilities of the monolithic Struts 1.x controller into individual layers,
whose features may be composed in appropriate combinations based
on the requirements of a particular application.
</em></blockquote>

<p>To that end, the following primary layers are proposed:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Application</strong> - Framework for performing processing
    that is required on every incoming request, plus a place to plug in
    application-wide services that are offered as standard plug-ins.</li>
<li><strong>Dialog</strong> - Framework for managing a series of individual
    interactions with the same user, necessary to complete a particular
    business transaction, plus a mechanism for plugging in predefined
    dialog services that are offered as standard plug-ins.</li>
<li><strong>View</strong> - Framework for elegantly combining a view tier
    technology that actually composes an individual HTTP response with the
    corresponding business logic interactions (to retrieve or modify data
    in the model tier), as well as handle user interface events activated
    by the user.</li>
</ul>

<p>The features provided by each of these layers are further described
in the following sections.</p>


<h3>2.2 Application Controller</h3>

<p>There continue to be framework responsibilities that are best discharged
by preprocessing (and/or postprocessing) every request, or every request that
meets certain criteria.  Shale will leverage the <code>Filter</code> APIs of
the servlet container to provide mechanisms to plug in individual application
level functionality for purposes such as:<p>
<ul>
<li>Access logging</li>
<li>Authentication and authorization</li>
<li>Performance statistic gathering</li>
<li>Compression of large responses</li>
<li>Unwrapping of incoming content types other than the default
    (<code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code>)</li>
<li>Remapping of incoming requests to alternate (or locale-specific) URLs</li>
</ul>

<p>Depending upon the nature of the individual pieces being integrated, it
might be more user friendly to configure a single <code>Filter</code> that
used a customizable "chain of responsibility" design pattern (like that
provided by Commons Chain) to implement the actual behavior performed for
each incoming request.</p>

<p>In the specific case of authentication and authorization, Shale must
interoperate both with applications wishing to utilize container managed
security, as well as those providing their own technology.  In both cases,
it is expected that the outcome of performing authentication and
authorization activities will be made visible to the application via return
values of the (potentially wrapped) servlet/portlet request methods
<code>getRemoteUser()</code>, <code>getUserPrincipal()</code>, and
<code>isUserInRole()</code>.</p>

<p>Separate from the core of Shale, we should consider supporting a
subproject that provides functionally complete plug-ins that implement
functionalities of the types described above.  In particular, a complete
user administration system (with support for "remember me" cookies) would
be a popular feature useful in many application environments.</p>


<h3>2.3 Dialog Controller</h3>

<p>Nearly all modern MVC-based frameworks for web application development
provide some level of support for the "application controller" functionality
described in the previous section, as well as the "view controller" capabilities
described next.  However, relatively few of them deal with an intermediate
requirement to manage a "dialog" or "conversation" with the application user
that spans multiple HTTP requests.  Dealing with this complexity is left as
an "exercise left for the reader" -- a state of affairs that Struts 2.x should
change.</p>

<p>Although this portion of the "Shale" proposal is the least fleshed out in
terms of an thinking through a possible implementation approach, it offers an
opportunity for substantially improving the productivity of developers building
applications based on Struts.  Therefore, let us define the requirements that
must be met by an implementation of a controller for dialogs:</p>
<ul>
<li>It must be possible to maintain a set of state information for a
    dialog across multiple HTTP requests.</li>
<li>It must be possible for an application user to engage in more than one
    dialog simultaneously (for example a non-modal pop-up wizard dialog
    running at the same time as the main line application's dialog, perhaps
    with a third dialog rendering context-sensitive help in another window).
    </li>
<li>It must be possible to describe the set of views involved in a dialog
    (and, implicitly, their corresponding event handlers in a backing bean)
    in such a manner that navigation can be performed by an event handler
    for one view, without having to be aware of the details of the overall
    structure of the entire dialog.</li>
<li>Description of a dialog should include not only support for navigation
    (first, previous, next, last, and so on) but also some mechanism for
    scripting the entire dialog's flow.  Examples of descriptions might be
    some scripting language that supports "continuations" (i.e. the ability
    to suspend execution and restart it later), or Java APIs that make state
    saving and restoring easy to perform in view-specific event handlers.</li>
<li>Dialog descriptions must be self documenting enough for tools to be
    able to produce high quality user experiences at design time.</li>
<li>In addition to generic navigation, the dialog controller
    must support one or more mechanisms to exit from the dialog (typically
    via "finish" and "cancel" controls, but not limited to these).</li>
<li>To the maximum degree feasible, the dialog controller must manage the
    browser's "back" and "forwards" buttons, treating them as if the
    corresponding navigation controls had been utilized (in terms of
    undoing and redoing changes to the state information being maintained).
    Clearly, this will require restrictions on persistent changes to model
    tier data performed as each step of the dialog is executed, but those
    restrictions should be explicitly documented and easy to obey.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2.4 View Controller</h3>

<p>Shale will support a mechanism that provides a 1:1 relationship between
a view tier presentation technology responsible for creating an HTTP response
(such as a JSP page), and a corresponding Java class containing event handling
logic, (optionally) values used in the dynamic rendering of the response, and
(optionally) bindings to the individual user interface components included in
the response page.  Such a Java class is known (in JSF terminology) as a
"backing bean," and will in most circumstances be registered as a managed
bean in the JSF configuration resources.</p>

<p>JSF does not require that a backing bean implement any particular interface,
or extend any particular base class.  Therefore, Shale should not impose any
such restriction either.  It should merely promise to ensure that a bean of the
appropriate class (selected by a pluggable mapper that translates the JSF
view identifier into a class name) will be present -- normally in request
scope -- when needed to process an incoming form submit, or to render a newly
created view.</p>

<p>However, if an application's backing bean happens to implement a lightweight
<code>ViewController</code> interface defined by Shale, several lifecycle
related methods will be called by the framework:</p>
<ul>
<li>The backing bean will possess the following properties useful in
    conditionally performing application logic based on the current
    processing state:
    <ul>
    <li><strong>dialog</strong> - The <code>DialogController</code> instance
        for the dialog that this view is a participant in, if any.</li>
    <li><strong>postBack</strong> - Boolean property indicating whether this
        view (and corresponding backing bean) will be processing an incoming
        form request, or only rendering output for a newly created view.</li>
    </ul></li>
<li>The following lifecycle methods will be called by the framework at the
    indicated times:
    <ul>
    <li><strong>init()</strong> - Called after a backing bean instance has been
        created and framework-defined properties (see above) have been set.
        This is a useful place to acquire resources that will be needed for
        either a form submit or for rendering a new view.</li>
    <li><strong>preprocess()</strong> - Called after a view has been restored
        (in JSF terms, this happens at the end of <em>Restore View</em> phase).
        This method is only called for a postback request, and is useful for
        acquiring references to model data that will be needed during the
        processing of the postback (in JSF terms, <em>Apply Request Values</em>
        through <em>Invoke Application</em> phases).</i>
    <li><strong>prerender()</strong> - Called immediate before the currently
        selected view is rendered (in JSF terms, this happens at the beginning
        of <em>Render Response</em> phase, before the <code>encode()</code>
        methods of the components have been called).  This method is only
        called for a view that is actually going to be rendered, in the
        case where the view being rendered is different from the view that
        responded to a form submit.  As such, it is a useful place to acquire
        references to model data that is required in the rendering of
        this view.</li>
    <li><strong>destroy()</strong> - Called after rendering has been completed,
        for all <code>ViewController</code>s that have had their
        <code>init()</code> method called during this request.</li>
    </ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Other than implementing a Shale-defined interface, a
<code>ViewController</code> need not have any other dependence on the
framework.  Thus, it remains easy to unit test such a bean outside of
a servlet container environment.</p>

<p>When coding the action method corresponding to a form's submit button,
Shale should encourage best practices in terms of delegating business
logic to the model tier, rather than implementing it directly in the action
method.  One approach to this might be to provide helper methods that make
it easy to encapsulate the current request state (including the current
instance of the backing bean, which would include all the incoming input
field values) into a context that is then passed to a "chain of responsibility"
implementation such as Commons Chain for performing the actual business logic
processing.</p>

<p>Best practices for JSF include storing backing beans in request scope,
rather than in page scope.  Because such beans are instantiated anew for each
request, and are accessed only by a single thread, there are no thread safety
concerns (as there are with Struts 1.x Actions) related to instance variables.
However, this also means that state required across more than one request
needs to be stored elsewhere (because the backing bean will be thrown away
at the end of the request).</p>


<h3>2.5 Functionality Not Included In The Shale Core</h3>

<p>Compared to Struts 1.x, support for client side validation and layout
management (Tiles) are explicitly excluded from the core controller framework.
This is not based on any belief that the functionality is not valuable -- it
belongs properly in the view tier, and should be managed there as a separate
subproject.</p>


<hr/><a name="Infrastructure"></a>
<h2>3. Infrastructure</h2>

<p>A key aspect of designing a framework is to choose which features it
implements itself, and which capabilities it imports as dependencies.  The
"Shale" proposal contemplates the following dependency choices, with
individual implementations proposed for some of them.  Shale will then
provide its own APIs in the controller tier that leverage these capabilities.
</p>

<h3>3.1 Java2 Standard Edition APIs</h3>

<p><em>Proposal</em>: JDK Version 1.4</p>

<p>Picking a base J2SE platform is a tradeoff between wanting to use all
the latest and greatest features of the most recent platform (for the
purposes of this discussion, JDK 5.0) and the realities of how many
developers will have the possibility of deploying applications based on
that platform when we release the initial version of Shale.  Currently,
Struts 1.x requires a minimum of JDK 1.2 (because it uses the collection
classes extensively).</p>

<p>JDK 1.4 represents a slightly aggressive choice given the current state
of the market, but relies on a reasonable assumption that JDK 1.4 will
become widely deployed over the next 12-18 months (in particular because
JDK 1.4 is a required baseline for the upcoming generation of J2EE 1.4
platform application servers).  The key technological reasons for this
choice (over a more conservative choice of JDK 1.3) include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Integration of JAXP (XML parsing and transformations) into the base
    platform, eliminating the need to worry about providing such libraries
    as part of a web application or separate plugin to a web container.</li>
<li>New I/O APIs allow the applications that leverage the potentially
    higher performance access to the filesystem.</li>
<li>Inclusion of critical security APIs (JSSE for "https" protocol access,
    and JAAS for authorization and authentication) into the base
    platform.</li>
<li>JDBC 3.0 integration, including connection pools (data sources)
    and rowsets.</li>
<li>Assertion facility, allowing developers to create assertions that can
    be conditionally compiled.</li>
<li>Chained exceptions, which (if used correctly) allows underlying causes
    to be included in a business tier exception, without tying to specific
    APIs unnecessarily.</li>
<li>Internationalization improvements, particularly support for
    Unicode 3.0.</li>
<li>Performance improvements in areas critical to the framework (such as
    reflection and object creation/garbage collection).</li>
</ul>

<h3>3.2 Java2 Enterprise Edition APIs</h3>

<p><em>Proposal</em>: J2EE Version 1.4 Platform APIs</p>

<p>For Struts, the most important platform API is the Servlet Specification.
Although Servlet 2.4 (the version included in J2EE 1.4) was fairly modest
in the scope of its changes, several of them are important to the architecture
of a web application framework:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lifecycle and event listeners for requests (as well as sessions
    and the entire application).</li>
<li>Filters can be applied across RequestDispatcher calls, not only
    on the original request.</li>
<li>Ability to specify a servlet path as a welcome file, without needing
    an actual artifact.</li>
<li>Clarifications in ordering of event handler calls ensure consistent
    behavior across implementations.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3.3 View (Presentation) Tier APIs</h3>

<p><em>Proposal:</em>: JavaServer Faces 1.1</p>

<p>Prior to the development of JavaServer Faces, web application frameworks
were on their own in terms of supporting mechaisms for user interface components
and the corresponding request processing lifecycle.  The standardization of JSF
provides an opportunity to build on top of a functionally capable API that is
slated to become part of the J2EE 5.0 platform, and which provides useful
(from the viewpoint of a framework) functionality in many areas beyond just
the user interface components themselves, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Well-defined request processing lifecycle with appropriate
    extension points for inserting application framework functionality.</li>
<li>Built-in support for page navigation based on logical outcomes
    from event handlers.</li>
<li>Managed beans facility that provides on-demand creation of
    JavaBeans, including setter injection to configure their
    properties.</li>
<li>Powerful expression language evaluation mechanisms, allowing
    dynamically scripted value retrievals, value settings, and
    method calls.</li>
<li>Expression evaluation is extensible in two ways ... through
    plug-in variable resolvers (can provide linkage into existing
    hierarchies of data) and plug-in property resolvers (can
    redefine what the "." operator in an expression does, based
    on the type of object it is being applied to).</li>
</ul>

<p>Without JSF, we would likely have to reinvent much of this functionality
(or leverage the similar, but more primitive, implementations of these ideas
in existing Struts code or other framworks).  With JSF, we can leverage the
extensibility of the basic framework to enable the division of controller
responsibilities at the view (page), dialog, and application level that is the
key feature of the entire proposal.</p>


<h3>3.4 Model Tier and Persistence APIs</h3>

<p>Struts should remain agnostic about technologies to be employed for
representing business logic, model data, and persistence.  However,
functional examples should be provided that encourage the use of best
practices in application design.</p>

<h3>3.5 Service Provisioning APIs</h3>

<p>Inversion of Control (IoC) containers (the techniques are also referred
to as Dependency Injection) are becoming a popular mechanism for assembling
the required services and logic of an application.  If Struts included such
a framework, it would provide a solid basis for building maintainable apps,
as well as allowing the framework to configure itself using the same
capabilities.</p>

<p>Rather than building such a container ourselves, we should seek to
incorporate an existing one that is license-compatible and which can
be integrated into the JSF managed beans facilities (so that value binding
and method binding expressions can leverage the facilities of this
container transparently).  From my research so far, I like Spring's
capabilities in this area the best, but am open to other suggestions.</p>

<h3>3.6 Authentication and Authorization APIs</h3>

<p>In order to support reasonably complete solutions for applications that
wish to provide their own authentication and authorization services (as well
as interact with container managed security), we need APIs available for
performing user registration, implementing "remember me" features, and
represent the results via a wrapped request (so that apps depending on
getRemoteUser(), getUserPrincipal(), and isUserInRole() will still work).
Using JDK 1.4 as a base platform would allow us to integrate mechanisms
like JAAS.  Other alternatives include plugins like SecurityFilter.</p>

<h3>3.7 State Management APIs</h3>

<p>The proposed solutions for dialog management require a framework for
managing state across multiple HTTP requests.  This is likely to be an
area where considerable investigation is needed before picking a fundamental
technology.  Things that seem feasible based on my initial review are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Modified Rhino with support for continuations (as used in
    <a href="http://cocoon.apache.org/2.1/userdocs/flow/">Cocoon Flow</a>
    and Don Brown's <a href="http://struts.sourceforge.net/struts-flow/">
    Struts Flow</a> plugin). I'll feel better about this if/when the
    modifications are part of a mainstream Rhino release, however.</li>
<li>An updated version of <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/sandbox/workflow/">
    Commons Workflow</a> that leverages the expression language APIs
    of either JSF or something like JEXL, but also supports continuations.</li>
<li>Working with the <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/jelly">Jelly</a>
    folks to add continuations support.</li>
<li>Giving up on explicit continuations support, and providing Java APIs
    that make explicit saving and restoring of state easier.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3.8 Logging APIs</h3>

<p><em>Proposal</em>: Commons Logging</p>

<p>Logging is an important feature of both an application framework itself
(to help developers understand the dynamic behavior of the framework) and
for building high quality applications.  If the proposal for JDK 1.4 is
accepted, we could potentially mandate using the java.util.logging APIs;
however, many Struts users prefer to use alternative logging implementations
such as Log4J.  Commons Logging provides a portable adapter layer that allows
the use of different logging implementations under the covers.</p>
