This directory is a whiteboard area for working on new material 
related to the adoption of WebWork2 as Action2. 

Until a stable release of Action2 is available, this material 
is being based on OS WebWork 2.2.

Note this area is intended for *NEW* material only. Existing 
WebWork material will enter Apache Struts through the incubation 
process. 

At this time, the material is being built directly with IDEA, 
and a standard build file is not yet available. 

For the time being, the dependencies required to build this
material may be downloaded here: 

* http://people.apache.org/~husted/sandbox-action2-lib.zip
